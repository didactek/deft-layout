/// - Note: To make it easy to encode enums in Layout classes, we strive to avoid requiring *any*
/// extensions to enums. Enums that specify an encoding conform to `RawRepresentable`,
/// which provides all needed functionality. Identifying a minimal subset of `RawRepresentable`'s
/// needed functionality makes it less work to adapt additional types.

    /// Integer wide enough to hold any representation of this type. The representation should
    /// be reasonably compact and use bits of RawValue starting from the least signficant.

// It would be nice to give generic instruction to the compiler that certain protocols can and should be adapted to BitEmbeddable when they are needed for the property wrapper.
//
// Such a feature would reduce the user-facing boilerplate in every enum declaration--declarations where the compiler synthetically injects the RawRepresentable but doesn't know about our desire for conformance to another protocol.

// As of Swift 5.2, extending protocols in this way is not part of the language, but there is discussion surrounding it. It would be useful (and expressive) in cases like this, but it would also complicate runtime facets of the type system. For more, see:
